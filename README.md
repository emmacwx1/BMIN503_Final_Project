# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
Emma Chen
Project: Using R packages to evaluate effectiveness of combined therapy of JAK inhibitor with antiPD1 immune checkpoint blockade

Data files: 
8 .fcs files representating 8 timepoints of flow cytometry data from processed PBMC samples. 1000 events each collected because of computer running power limitation. (longitudinal data across 8 timepoints)

There are 4 objectives in total.
-First is to use different R packages to analyze both flow and mass cytometry data; current analysis workflow is to use FlowJo or CyTOF to analyze cytometry data. But as manual gating is time consuming for so many markers and very subjective according to the person doing analysis, we decided to explore if R packages could finish some steps in analysis workflow.
-Second is to design and simplify (longitudinal) data analysis workflow for different dataset type, different study goals, different dataset size, variables, etc.
-Third is so compare Immune Checkpoint Blockage (ICB) only versus both JAK inhibitors and ICB combination, allowing us to confirm main hypothesis whether IFN pathway inhibition improve ICB immunotherapy effects. 
-Last, to pipeline analyzing multiple patients' data.

First two objectives are completed as described in HTML file. Aim to compared the third one. Last objective will need to do on lab computer because of data amount.
